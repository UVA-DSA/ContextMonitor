This repository contains a real-time context-aware monitoring system for Robot-Assisted Surgery. The system aims to improve safety in tele-operated surgery by inferring the operational context from the time-series kinematics data of the robot and then detecting unsafe events using a library of erroneous gesture classifier (dsn2020) or checking for constraint violation (ismr2020).
